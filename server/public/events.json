A supremely gifted musician, he will be sorely missed by the students whose lives he touched and by all who had the good fortune to have known him. Mr. Niemann joined the Hoff-Barthelson faculty in 1999. During his tenure with the School, he served as a member of the piano and advanced level musicianship faculties. An ardent advocate for the study and performance of contemporary music, Mr. Niemann was the coordinator of the School’s annual Music of Our Time contemporary music festival. He also created the School’s Performers Showcase.\n\nA concert in his memory, featuring performances by the School’s faculty, students and alumni, will be held on Sunday, October 9, 2016, at 2:00 pm at Hoff-Barthelson Music School, 25 School Lane Scarsdale, NY. A reception will follow.\n\nIt is the wish of his family that gifts in memory of Edmund be made to Hoff-Barthelson in support of either its financial aid program or contemporary music programming and education. To make a donation, please visit http://hbms.org/honoring-edmund-niemann.php. This link may also be used to RSVP to attend the October 9th celebration.\n\nPianist Edmund Niemann was a member of Steve Reich and Musicians and a founding member of the contemporary ensemble Parnassus. He also appeared as guest artist with the New York New Music Ensemble, the Da Capo Players, Speculum Musicae, and Newband. The New York Times said of his solo debut, &quot;throughout the evening his playing was technically dazzling, his musicality unquestionable.&quot;\n\nHe and Nurit Tilles formed the piano duo, Double Edge, which made its New York debut at Town Hall in 1987. The duo performed throughout Europe, Australia and the U.S. In March 2008, Double Edge returned to Los Angeles to play Visions de l’Amen in a celebration of Messiaen’s centenary. Mr. Niemann held two degrees from the Manhattan School of Music. Niemann was also an adjunct professor at Princeton University.\n\nAbout Hoff-Barthelson Music School: \nOne of Westchester County’s most cherished and active cultural resources, Hoff-Barthelson Music School has achieved national recognition as a premier community music school for its unsurpassed leadership in education, performance and outreach for more than seventy years.","modified":"2016-09-06 10:16:04","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Hoff-Barthelson Music School pays tribute to the memory of faculty member Edmund Niemann","venue_address":"25 School Ln","geocode_type":"City Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"HBMS","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/032/564/016-6.jpeg_/hoffbarthelson-music-school-pays-tribute-memory-fa-16.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/032/564/016-6.jpeg_/hoffbarthelson-music-school-pays-tribute-memory-fa-16.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/032/564/016-6.jpeg_/hoffbarthelson-music-school-pays-tribute-memory-fa-16.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/032/564/016-6.jpeg_/hoffbarthelson-music-school-pays-tribute-memory-fa-16.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-09-06 10:01:17","venue_id":"V0-001-004058525-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Hoff-Barthelson Music School","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/hoffbarthelson-music-school-/V0-001-004058525-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"10591","going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"41.0762630","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/ballet-des-amriques-and-music-hall-invite-you-spe-/E0-001-096244685-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096244685-9","privacy":"1","city_name":"Tarrytown","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.8583443","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-10-01 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <b>Company:</b> Ballet des Amériques<br><b>Venue:</b> Music Hall<br><b>Location:</b> Tarrytown, NY<br><br> Shamsher Dhanoa <br><p><br> Ballet des Amériques and the Music Hall invite you to a special performance at Tarrytown&#39;s magnificent historic theater -

While there may never be another classical guitarist like Segovia, this young Australian left his Marlow Guitar Series audience with the impression that someday there may not be the likes of him again, either. - THE WASHINGTON POST New York-based Australian classical guitarist Rupert Boyd is acclaimed as one of the most talented guitarists of his generation. He has been described by The Washington Post as truly evocative, and by Classical Guitar Magazine as a player who deserves to be heard. His performances have taken him across four continents, from New Yorks Carnegie Hall, to the Barcelona Guitar Festival in Spain, Strings-139 Festival in China, Gharana Music Festival in Nepal, and every state and territory in mainland Australia. In addition to his Carnegie Hall debut as part of the DAddario Music Foundations International Competition Winners in Concert Series, Rupert Boyds recent performance highlights include the Newport Music Festival, Music in the Strathmore Mansion, Marlow Guitar Series, Grand Canyon Guitar Society, Boston Guitar Society, University of Denver and University of Hawaii. In New York, Rupert Boyd has performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York City Classical Guitar Society, Merkin Concert Hall, Trinity Wall Street, Bargemusic, SubCulture, and with a diversity of groups such as New York Festival of Song and Moving Theater Dance Company. Rupert Boyds debut recording Valses Poéticos received the following review in the UK magazine Classical Guitar: The performances that Boyd gives here are first-rate... Even the Bach is one of the best of its kind. Soundboard, the Guitar Foundation of Americas quarterly publication, gave the CD the following review: Boyds playing is beautifully refined, with gorgeous tone musically and technically flawless the album is first-rate. Soundboard also described the eponymous work by Granados as one of the best recorded performances of this work on guitar. Active as both a soloist and chamber musician, Rupert Boyd regularly performs throughout the world as half of the Australian Guitar Duo with guitarist Jacob Cordover. The duo has performed throughout the world, including appearances in the United States, France, Spain, China, the Philippines and all throughout Australia. The duo was a prizewinner of the Chamber Music section of the Australian Guitar Competition, and their debut CD Songs from the Forest was released in March 2012 and was described as wonderfully entertaining by Classical Guitar Magazine, and very impressive by Soundboard Magazine. Rupert Boyd holds a Bachelor of Music (First Class Honours) from the Australian National University School of Music, a Master of Music from the Manhattan School of Music and an Artist Diploma from the Yale University School of Music. His major teachers have been Timothy Kain, David Leisner and Benjamin Verdery. In addition to winning the Andrés Segovia award from the Manhattan School of Music, Rupert Boyd was a winner of the Lillian Fuchs Chamber Music Competition and winner of the Eisenberg-Fried Concerto Competition.

It wakes you up. Their brand of original and traditional American Roots music blends Olde Time, Blues, 2nd Line, Bluegrass, and Folk Rock with a pinch of Punk Rock energy to create a uniquely modern mix. Lead by song-writing couple, Mark Miller and Beth Kaufman, this six piece powerhouse brings barn burning energy to venues across the East Coast and beyond.\n\nIt’s an exciting time for the Hudson Valley based band. Their acclaimed CD, “The Social Music Hour Vol 1” was nominated for Best Folk Album of the Year by The International Folk Alliance.  A love letter to the Anthology of American Folk Music, the project features lyrically relevant, known but not worn out, open for suggestion songs that thrive with re-interpretation. Familiar, forgotten words find new meaning in this historically informed but thoroughly contemporary treatment. The tracks pay respect to early folk artists, the likes of Leadbelly, Elizabeth Cotton, Big Bill Broonzy, Woody Guthrie and more.  They burst with life, joy and fresh, edgy vitality.\n\nA festival favorite, the band has played featured shows at Citi Field, Musikfest, The Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, and Clearwater. The 2016 summer season found the band at the the South Florida Folk Festival, in Israel headlining the Jacob’s Ladder Festival, Vermont’s Roots On The River, Caramoor’s American Roots Music Festival in New York, The New Bedford Folk Festival,The Great South Bay Music Festival and The Philadelphia Folk Festival.

The Detroit-born Singer-Songwriter fits snugly between Folk and Soul. Whether singing about heartbreak, following dreams, or historical fiction; his perspective coupled with his command of language is incredible. It&#39;s no surprise in 2013, he won an International Songwriting Award.Along with his gift for writing critically acclaimed songs (Huffington Post, Chicago Tribune, American Songwriter) comes his ability to captivate his audience in a live setting. Armed only with a guitar, Briar Rabbit uses his strong, soulful tenor, and quick wit to deliver both a musically and emotionally dynamic performance. Phillip-Michael has spent time all over.

Swing&#39;s style of composition draws on classical, folk and alternative influences to create a &quot;rich and lilting soundscape. Live performance as a duo features cello loops, synths, electronic beats and transcendent vocals. &quot;Swing demonstrates his vocal prowess with delicate intonation,&quot; delivering lyrics imbued with poetry. After graduating with a Latin degree, Wes taught for three years before quitting his teaching job and turning to music full time. A love of the classics comes through in his imagist lyrics and arrangements, and his first full length debut album is titled Through a Fogged Glass. The album is a landscape of sound, having been written and arranged as one complete work, with the album artwork a landscape painting by Bolanle Adeboye. Swing wrote most of the album in a cabin in the Virginia woods. Since the release of &quot;Through a Fogged Glass&quot; on vinyl and CD, Wes Swing and band have toured throughout the USA and Europe. His music is featured regularly on NPR and by several modern dance companies. He is currently working on two new albums of music (to be released in 2016), and a book of short stories.","modified":"2016-08-30 11:12:13","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"wesswingmusic","linker":"evdb","name":"Wes Swing","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Wes-Swing?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000320787-0","short_bio":"alt-folk, cello"}},"title":"Wes Swing","venue_address":"196 Allen Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/015/265/708-9.jpeg_/wes-swing-08.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/015/265/708-9.jpeg_/wes-swing-08.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/015/265/708-9.jpeg_/wes-swing-08.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/015/265/708-9.jpeg_/wes-swing-08.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-08-26 00:48:22","venue_id":"V0-001-001015033-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Rockwood Music Hall","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/rockwood-music-hall-/V0-001-001015033-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"10002","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.722482","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/nick-howard-/E0-001-094901298-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-094901298-1","privacy":"1","city_name":"New York","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.9886929","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-11-09 20:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <br> Nick Howard could never be accused of sitting still. Following a 2 year stretch in which the British singer-songwriter has played 300 shows across Europe and the US, enjoyed his first number 1, packed in several headlining tours and even managed to learn German in two months and win the hugely popular TV show The Voice of Germany, Nick Howard recently released his fourth and latest album Living In Stereo. Living In Stereo includes his single &#39;Untouchable&#39; (co-written and produced with Grammy nominated writer/producer Toby Gad) which was released in Europe at the beginning of the year and has been supported by fantastic radio play & several notable TV appearances including a performance in front of 1 million people at the Brandenburg Gate on New Year&#39;s Eve. The single reached the Top 10 on the German mainstream radio charts (the only independent release in the Top 20), made the Top 10 in Italy and was the most played independent song on Italian radio.Nicks musical journey began in New York, where he had moved as a 21 year old to pursue his music career. He spent several years working various 9-5 jobs (secretly booking gigs and writing songs whilst pretending to work) in addition to working as a waiter and bartender at night (where he claims he was the worst bartender in the city) to support his dream. He would write, record and perform whenever and wherever possible (he jokes that his first show was at such an obscure venue that even the Google van couldn&#39;t find it) and by having his music used over 40 times in TV shows such as The Hills, Jersey Shore, Pretty Little Liars, Switched at Birth, Army Wives, LA Ink and 90210, Nick was able to support himself as an independent artist.After touring with bands such as Lifehouse & Boyce Avenue in Europe and supporting the likes of Train, Gavin DeGraw and Jack Johnson in the US, Nick managed to build a loyal fan base in both continents and auditioned for &#39;The Voice of Germany&#39; as a way to introduce his music to a bigger audience, choosing Germany because his fans there were the first to embrace and support his music. Nick learned to speak German just two months before the first show. After several months of writing and recording in Los Angeles, London, New York and Nashville in 2013, Nick has spent most of 2014 on the road in the US and Europe promoting his new material, playing over 200 shows to over 100,000 fans all over the world.Catch Nick at a live show while you can, he doesnt sit still for long.","modified":"2016-07-10 09:54:44","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"kingnick_howard","linker":"evdb","name":"Nick Howard","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Nick-Howard?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000139857-6","short_bio":"British Singer/Songwriter Official Page"}},"title":"Nick Howard","venue_address":"196 Allen Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/003/858/093-3.jpeg_/nick-howard-93.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/003/858/093-3.jpeg_/nick-howard-93.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/003/858/093-3.jpeg_/nick-howard-93.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/003/858/093-3.jpeg_/nick-howard-93.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-10 09:54:44","venue_id":"V0-001-001015033-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Rockwood Music Hall","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/rockwood-music-hall-/V0-001-001015033-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.7128552","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/twice-proper-e-indigo-/E0-001-095878586-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095878586-7","privacy":"1","city_name":"Brooklyn","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.9480416","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-09-17 21:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Line-up /<p>E Indigo, <a>Craft</a>, Headliner, <a>Shadi</a><p> Party People unite in Brooklyn!<br><br> For this event, we are creating an intimate atmosphere in a new space.

Otan Vargas (Born on October 4, 1984 in Manila, Philippines) is a Filipino who moved to New York in 2006. He is proud to say that he was born and raised in Tondo, known to be the poorest place in Manila--&quot;A Place&quot; that emphatically influenced his music. He started his solo acoustic career in 2006. His honest music captivated fans from all over the world, giving testimonials of how its melancholy touched them beautifully. He has performed at several New York City venues including The Bitter End, The Bowery Electric, and Gramercy Theater. Vargas also performed in Wantagh, NY at the Jones Beach Bandshell in 2010, 2012, 2013 & 2014 for crowds numbering up to 5000. 2011 had Vargas performing alongside Aaron Lewis, Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour, Tesla, and Lo-Pro at the It Takes A Community benefit show. This 2-night charity concert in Northampton, MA supported the non-profit organization founded by Aaron Lewis and his wife, Vanessa, in order to raise funds for reviving rural communities throughout the greater New England area. Vargas also took his first cross country mini-tour in summer 2012, traveling as far as Houston (House of Blues) and Dallas (House of Blues) where he was again well received by audiences.Otans honesty is what has captivated so many of his devoted fans through recent successes such as the 2013 EP, Selected Sorrow. The EP contained Hollow Destination an aching, lost-soul song featured in the documentary film, Battlefield of the Mind. Produced by Fran Strine (Pantera, Staind, Five Finger Death Punch, Seether) the documentary offered a soundtrack including artists such as Mike Mushok of Staind, Pete Murray of Lo Pro, and many more. Vargas traveled from his New York residence to perform at the Los Angeles Battlefield of the Mind Live Event, sharing the stage with David Ellefson of Megadeth, Troy McLawhorn of Evanescence, Sal G of Staind, Eye Empire, and Lo Pro at the legendary venue Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, CA. This Filipino born artist received due recognition in 2009 when Staind frontman, Aaron Lewis, discovered Vargas on YouTube covering one of his songs. Lewis later invited Vargas onstage at The Music Box Borgata Hotel and Casinos to perform Stainds Its Been Awhile, his rendition eliciting a standing ovation from the crowd.","modified":"2016-08-23 11:55:26","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"Otan","linker":"evdb","name":"Otan Vargas","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Otan-Vargas?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000072672-7","short_bio":"Acoustic/Grunge"}},"title":"Otan Vargas","venue_address":"196 Allen Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/651/742-2.jpeg_/otan-vargas-42.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/651/742-2.jpeg_/otan-vargas-42.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/651/742-2.jpeg_/otan-vargas-42.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/651/742-2.jpeg_/otan-vargas-42.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-08-21 03:48:48","venue_id":"V0-001-001015033-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Rockwood Music Hall","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/rockwood-music-hall-/V0-001-001015033-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"11530","going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"40.7196554","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/adelphi-chamber-music-ensemble-/E0-001-094293960-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-094293960-7","privacy":"1","city_name":"Garden City","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.6519438","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-12-07 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <strong>Adelphi Chamber Music Ensemble</strong><br><strong> Event, Music, Garden City Event, Performing Arts Series </strong><br><p>Christopher Lyndon-Gee, <em>director</em><p><em>Featuring the students of the Department of Music.</em><p>A program of intimate music for a variety of voices and instruments, ranging from Baroque to the modern is performed by Adelphi music students.<br> <br><strong>For further information, please contact:</strong><br><p><a href=\"http://music.adelphi.edu/faculty/\" title=\"Department of Music\" rel=\"nofollow\">Department of Music</a><br>p – 516.877.4290<br>\n <br><br>Westermann Stage, Concert Hall<br><br>Cost:<b>Free event</b><br></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-06-18 14:48:00","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Adelphi Chamber Music Ensemble","venue_address":"1 South Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2016-06-18 14:48:00","venue_id":"V0-001-000304468-8","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Adelphi University","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/adelphi-university-/V0-001-000304468-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.7142","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/improvised-musical-class-show-/E0-001-096082998-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096082998-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"New York","link_count":null,"longitude":"-74.0064","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-09-10 18:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Witness the Reckless approach to musical improv, as this class tackles dance as well as song to create a fully realized musical.

Consisting of the pioneering American classical guitarists Thomas Flippin & Christopher Mallett, Duo Noire has been hailed as a &quot;virtuosic pair&quot; and has performed across the world in distinguished venues such as the Norfolk Music Festival, the 92nd Street Y, Peking University (Beijing), the Times Center, and the St. Louis Classical Guitar Society as recurring Artists-in-Residence. Their debut album, Figments, consisted of &quot;a substantial piece...recorded in crystalline sound&quot; (Soundboard), which was written for them by the award-winning Juilliard professor Raymond Lustig. Praised for its &quot;impressive technique...Flippin and Mallett definitely don&#39;t disappoint&quot; (I Care if You Listen) ,&quot; the album has been broadcast on WNYC, WQXR, and Radio Arts Foundation St. Louis. Additionally, the duo has been featured in articles by Acoustic Guitar Magazine, Classical Guitar Magazine, Gendai Guitar, and on the cover of the Guitar Foundation of America&#39;s quarterly journal Soundboard. In 2015 the duo began their &quot;Women of Guitar Commissioning Project,&quot; to remedy the lack of gender diversity in classical guitar repertoire. Made possible through funding from the Diller-Quaile School of Music where Flippin is on faculty, Duo Noire is commissioning some of the most talented female composers of their generation to write for two guitars, including Drs. Courtney Bryan and Clarice Assad.

This trifecta of musical magic manifests itself on the band&#39;s third album, Home of the Strange, on Fueled by Ramen. <br><br> &quot;With these new songs, we&#39;ve fully embraced what it is to be lyricists. We&#39;re not trying to combine fiction writing and lyricism anymore,&quot; explains singer Sameer Gadhia, who mi-nored in fiction writing at Stanford University where he studied human biology before dropping out to pursue music. “We’ve also taken a collective approach to the thematic and lyrical development of each song on this album. Most of these songs came together during the demo process at either Seahorse Studios in downtown Los Angeles where Francois, Eric and I would spend hours collaborating over coffee on the rooftop, or at our producer’s home studio in West Los Angeles where we would do the same on his back patio. We used to view songwriting more like being a fly on the wall and not being in the story. But, on this record, we&#39;re in the story more than ever. It&#39;s personal, but universal at the same time.&quot;<br><br> The new record not only displays the group&#39;s new heights as lyricists and communicators, but it shows a rich, musical growth for the band as well. &quot;We&#39;ve always struggled to really capture what we do live on record. We accomplish that on this release. Now that we&#39;re on our third album we finally figured out how we need to work together. It helped that we had a theme and we all kept on that path in one solid mindset throughout the process.&quot; <br><br> The theme of Home of the Strange is of the modern American immigrant story. It&#39;s especially relevant to the quintet as they&#39;re from different ethnic backgrounds and most are immigrants or first-generation Americans. Gadhia is Indian-American, Jacob Tilley (guitar) is British, Eric Cannata (guitar/vocals) is a New Jersey-born Italian-Jewish, Payam Doostzadeh (bass) is Persian-American, and Francois Comtois (drums/vocals) is French-Canadian. But, it also speaks to anyone who feels like they don&#39;t belong, or feels marginalized, angry about the state of affairs of our nation (especially in this polarizing election year), or hopeless about a better future. <br><br> On &quot;Amerika,&quot; for instance, the band explores the idea of the American dream and how to reconcile that with the various cultures they each grew up with. The song, which USA Today named one of the 10 Best Songs of the Week, was inspired by Franz Kafka&#39;s unfinished novel of the same name. It&#39;s the story of a 16-year-old boy named Karl who flees Germany under uncertain circumstances looking for a better life in New York and struggles to find a place to belong between the two cultures. <br><br> &quot;We find ourselves searching for our own ethics in between the often-contradictory beliefs of this polarized American Modern Age and those of the romanticized cultures of our forefathers,&quot; reveals Gadhia, whom The New York Times declared &quot;one of the great contemporary rock voices.&quot; &quot;Our perspective is irreversibly tinged with this rhetoric of the immigrant conscience and guilt. Searching for the &#39;American dream&#39; is to lust for excess, power, and sex. We realize that when we achieve our goals, they often leave us more hollow than before.&quot;<br><br> &quot;Home of the Strange,&quot; meanwhile, is a tongue-in-cheek play on the national anthem. &quot;I&#39;ve always had to reconcile the ideals of my Indian culture that my parents tried to instill in me with what it means to be American and figuring out what my American dream is. There was always a conflict of where it is that I exist. Am I American? Am I Indian? I always felt that I was somewhere in-between. I wanted to find a place to belong.&quot;<br><br> &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; was inspired by conversations with students they met at colleges in 2015 while performing on tour. It’s about being brave enough to forge your own path if the one we&#39;re raised to follow fails. &quot;Everybody wants something to believe in,&quot; he says. &quot;But what many of us are taught to believe in - go to school, get a job, have a family - doesn&#39;t always work. Kids are coming out of college with serious debt and jobs are scarce. They&#39;re realizing the dream is broken. It can be liberating and scary at the same time to carve your own path instead.&quot; <br><br> The album&#39;s most hopeful song, &quot;Repeat,&quot; is a call to action to not repeat history. &quot;The only times people tend to make big changes is when they must - when they are faced with something greater than themselves. Things seem bad now with environmental issues, the economy, the job market, but sometimes the best changes come when we are at our lowest,&quot; says Gadhia.<br><br> Musically, the band came into the recording sessions with a specific sonic vision. &quot;We wanted a full, live band sound, but at the same time really direct and up-front. It&#39;s the per-fect combination of old school and new school. It&#39;s like a contemporary hi-fi record. We finally achieved that live sound we&#39;d been touching upon on previous records, but it&#39;s full realized on this one,&quot; says Gadhia of the sessions with producer Alex Salibian (Elle King, Mikky Ekko) and executive producer Jeff Bhasker (Kanye West, Jay Z, fun.), who won the 2016 Grammy Award for Producer of the Year for his work with Mark Ronson and Nate Ruess, among others.<br><br> The band also finally figured out how to truly write together as a band. &quot;Most bands don&#39;t actually write together,&quot; notes Gadhia. &quot;It&#39;s a great concept, but it wasn&#39;t until this record that we actually fully achieved it. Our new producer Alex really helped us get there. We realized the genesis of a song or its end point can come from any member. And we all switched around, too. We played different instruments. I played a Hammond organ on &#39;Amerika,&#39; and Jacob played vibraphone while Francois sang the verse. Overall, Fran and Eric sang and wrote more this time around. It&#39;s really our most collaborative effort.&quot; <br><br> Since the band&#39;s 2010 inception, Young the Giant has made a name for itself in rock as the &quot;thinking man&#39;s band,&quot; winning over fans, radio, and press with their incendiary live shows, strong musicianship, and poignant lyrics. The band&#39;s 2010 self-titled debut, which reached No. 6 on the Rock and Alternative album charts, featured the RIAA Gold-certified hits, &quot;Cough Syrup&quot; and &quot;My Body,&quot; which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4, respectively on Alternative Radio. The band&#39;s sophomore release 2014&#39;s Mind Over Matter hit No. 7 on The Billboard 200 and spawned the hits, &quot;It&#39;s About Time,&quot; which reached No. 2 on the Alternative Radio chart and the title track, which hit No. 15. <br><br> Even with chart successes, critical praise (Rolling Stone, Billboard), coveted television ap-pearances (The Late Show with David Letterman, MTV Video Music Awards), and high profile festivals (Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo), Young the Giant still feel like they have a lot more to do and, more important, a lot more to say as a band.<br><br> &quot;We have a platform and we have our own beliefs, but at the same time, what&#39;s amazing about songwriting, music, or literature is that it brings people together and it shows people that everyone has the same problems and wants the same thing. This record is really a call to consciousness to really understand our predicament,&quot; adds Gadhia.<br> This event is all ages","modified":"2016-06-11 07:26:00","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":[{"creator":"evdb","linker":"evdb","name":"Young The Giant","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Young-The-Giant?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000246319-6","short_bio":"Alternative"},{"creator":"claynferno","linker":"evdb","name":"Ra Ra Riot","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Ra-Ra-Riot?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000023656-1","short_bio":"Indie Rock / Baroque Pop"}]},"title":"Young The Giant With Ra Ra Riot","venue_address":"1260 Sixth Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/356/456-8.jpeg_/young-the-giant-56.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/356/456-8.jpeg_/young-the-giant-56.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/356/456-8.jpeg_/young-the-giant-56.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/356/456-8.jpeg_/young-the-giant-56.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-05-03 03:29:09","venue_id":"V0-001-001002646-8","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Radio City Music Hall","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/radio-city-music-hall-/V0-001-001002646-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"10314","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.608731","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/music-hour-sound-moves-/E0-001-096382623-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096382623-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"Staten Island","link_count":null,"longitude":"-74.153627","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-11-01 15:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" The Music Program of the Department of Performing and Creative Arts presents a Music Hour: Sound Moves: Spontaneous Invention with Prof. Bill Bauer, composer.

Hairspray, winner of 8 Tony Awards including Best Musical, is a family-friendly musical piled bouffant high with laughter, romance, and deliriously tuneful songs.

When her dream comes true, Tracy is transformed from social outcast to sudden star. She must use her newfound power to dethrone the reigning Teen Queen, win the affections of heartthrob Link Larkin, and integrate a TV network, all without denting her &#39;do!

In 2008, FIRE released its debut album “To The Four Corners” on the Naxos Records and is distributed worldwide. FIRE has recorded soundtracks for feature and documentary films such as I. M. Pei: Building China Modern (PBS American Masters Series), Emperor’s New Garden, and Stand Up. Comprised of both Eastern and Western instruments and some of today’s most gifted and promising young musicians, FIRE advocates music in a wide variety of styles, ranging from avant-garde modernism to world music, visual arts, and experimental music.<p>Momenta: the plural of momentum – four individuals in motion towards a common goal. This is the idea behind the <strong>Momenta Quartet</strong>, whose eclectic vision encompasses contemporary music of all aesthetic backgrounds alongside great music from the recent and distant past. Momenta has premiered over 100 works and collaborated with over 120 living composers and, in the words of the New Yorker’s Alex Ross, “few American players assume Haydn’s idiom with such ease.”</p></p></p>","modified":"2016-08-08 13:38:28","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Music of Huang Ruo","venue_address":"509 Atlantic Avenue","geocode_type":"City Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/031/393/913-7.jpeg_/music-huang-ruo-13.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/031/393/913-7.jpeg_/music-huang-ruo-13.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/031/393/913-7.jpeg_/music-huang-ruo-13.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/031/393/913-7.jpeg_/music-huang-ruo-13.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-08-08 13:38:28","venue_id":"V0-001-006584364-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Roulette","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/roulette-/V0-001-006584364-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"10023","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.7726351","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/independent-music-party-/E0-001-095832268-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095832268-6","privacy":"1","city_name":"New York","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.9841418","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-11-12 12:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <p>Be among the first to discover the year’s best independent artists and releases from around the world at this free, day-long festival presented by the <a href=\"http://www.independentmusicawards.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Independent Music Awards</a>.

Feel its power. It’s right there for you each moment….every second…every hour.” ~ From “Jenny’s Penny”\nWhile visiting her Grandma, a rare coin collector, Jenny learns the history of one very special 1943 wheat-ear copper penny. As she listens, “Penny’s” journey unfolds and so does a unique coin wisdom that can easily apply to anyone. Penny learns that mistakes are good opportunities; there is value in being different; life will get better even when it seems hopeless; envisioning wishes can make them come true; and that there is a treasure inside everyone, even if no one sees it yet! A magical, musical adventure for friends and family to enjoy! \n Book Signing by Ms. Young at each performance!\nGeneral admission tickets are $12 and are available online at www.RiverdaleY.org","modified":"2010-05-28 13:00:09","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Jenny's Penny Musical","venue_address":"5625 Arlington Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"riverdaley","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2009-10-07 11:51:17","venue_id":"V0-001-000276289-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2019-11-19 20:45:00","venue_name":"Riverdale Y","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/riverdale-y-/V0-001-000276289-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"10003","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.726589","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/cataldis-spaghetti-eastern-music-/E0-001-095473106-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095473106-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"New York","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.9898","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-10-21 21:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" A return of the acoustic and electric spectacular. Spaghetti Eastern Music is the solo project of NYC guitarist, keyboardist and singer Sal Cataldi. Cataldi fuses Eastern beat and funk-influenced guitar instrumentals with acoustic vocal tunes, much of it performed to the moves of his bellydancing collaborators Karen Wahl and Callista Zaki. Follows bellydance performance by Sirens Salome at 7:30 pm. Time Out New York writes: &quot;Cataldi&#39;s largely instrumental, Eastern-influenced jams are infused with some delicate guitar work and hauntingly moody atmosphere,&quot; while The New York Times proclaims Cataldi has “a beat unmistakably his own.” Called “truly excellent” by The Village Voice, “triumphantly funkified” by UPI and “wonderfully melodic and off-center” by WFMU’s Irene Trudel.
